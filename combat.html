	<h1>Engaging zombies</h1>
		<p>Combat with zombies is something that, while to be generally avoided, is likely inevitable.  Remember that in all cases destruction of the brain is essential.</p>

		<h2>One-on-one combat</h2>
			<p>In scenarios where you are facing an individual, or even a small group of zombies, the odds are in your favor.  Zombies are slow and clumbsy, and rely on overwhelming numbers to overcome their target.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>At all times, stay calm</li>
				<li>Evaulate the situation</li>
				<li>Eliminate your targets in order of priority</li>
			</ul>
	</section>
	<aside><p>Remember that it is not always necessary to engage - if you can safely bypass without direct confrontation, it is usually safest to do so.</aside>

		<h2>Fighting a horde</h2>
			<p>In scenarios where you are overwhelmed, it is important to stay calm and evaluate the situation.  Identify the nearest point of egress and make your way there immediately</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Identify the nearest safe area</li>
				<li>Find the path of least resistance</li>
				<li>Reevaluate action</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Remember - fighting a horde is about escaping the horde.  Actually destroying zombies in this number requires mass arms and ammunitions supply that most people simply will not have access to.</p>
