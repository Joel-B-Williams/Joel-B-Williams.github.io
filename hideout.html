	<h1>The keys to a safe and secure home territory</h1>
		<p>There are two main things to consider when looking for a functional safe haven during the zombie apocalypse: Security, and Supplies.</p>
	<section id="security">
		<h2>Security</h2>
			<p>Securing a zone from zombies is a unique lesson in safety.  Zombies are slow, shambling creatures, but en masse can break through many types of barricades.  Use their natural weaknesses against them.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Locate above ground level</li>
				<li>Use ladders/ropes/etc to climb, not ramps or stairs</li>
				<li>Close off all ground-level entrances</li>
			</ul>
	</section>
	<section id="supplies">
		<h2>Supplies</h2>
			<p>A well-stocked home base is essential to survival.  Remember the basics - food, water, and warmth.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>A supply of non-perishibles is essential</li>
				<li>A clean water supply is even more important</li>
			</ul>
